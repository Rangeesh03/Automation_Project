#Project Summary:
#Title: Web Automation Project for AJIO Application - Search Box Functionality

#Description:
This project focuses on automating the search box functionality of the AJIO application using web automation techniques. The goal is to create a robust and efficient testing framework to verify the functionality of the search box.

#Test Cases:
A total of 75 test cases have been written for the project. Each test case includes detailed steps to reproduce the test scenario, expected results, actual results, and status (pass/fail). These test cases cover various scenarios related to the search box functionality to ensure comprehensive testing.

#Framework:
The project utilizes a Hybrid Model framework that combines the strengths of the Page Object Model (POM) and Data-Driven Testing. The POM helps in maintaining a modular structure for test scripts, while Data-Driven Testing allows for parameterization and efficient handling of test data.

#Technologies Used:

Java: Used as the programming language for writing automation scripts, providing flexibility and versatility.
Selenium: Employed for web automation to interact with the AJIO application's user interface and perform various actions.
TestNG: Utilized as the testing framework to organize and execute test cases efficiently and generate reports.
Apache POI: Used to interact with Microsoft Excel files for reading and writing test data, enhancing data-driven capabilities.
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to ensure that the search box functionality of the AJIO application works as expected and provides accurate search results. By using the Hybrid Model framework and the selected technologies, the project aims to achieve thorough testing, maintainable code, and reliable automation results.

Through this project, the automation tester has honed their skills in Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Apache POI, while also gaining experience in designing and implementing a hybrid testing framework for web applications. The project demonstrates the ability to handle complex testing scenarios and contribute to the quality assurance of web-based software products.
